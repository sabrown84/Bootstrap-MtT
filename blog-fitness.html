                                        <h2>Rule #1: CONSISTENCY!</h2>
                                        <a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/P4a43pThV3c" target="_blank"><img class="img-responsive img-blog" src="images/blog/fit5.jpg" width="70%" alt="" /></a>
                                            <p>In fitness, consistency always has to be part of your plan. When it comes to weight management I used to tell my clients the number one rule is Nutrition. Mastery of the food you choose to consume is key. On the other hand, nothing you do in the gym will change what you decided to eat. No I tell them that CONSISTENTCY is what holds the two together. If you can be consistent with one then the other can certainly be put in line as well. And when you have both nutrition and fitness on the right track then you have maximal control. Name one thing you do consistently every single day? One thing you can't go a day without doing? Mine is reaching my arms up and stretching when I get out of bed in the morning. Maybe this seems trivial to you, but I look foward to it. It relaxes me, and I can even say it brings me joy when I think about it. It sets me up for the day ahead and gets my whole body in motion. Do you have anything that makes you feel that way?
                                            </p>
                                            <p>When it comes to fitness and nutrition I think of what would make me get into the same mindset as my morning stretch? LOL! Writing about this makes it seems so ridiculous, right? Well what do look forward to about fitness? Music is the best part of fitness for me...it really brings me joy! I get to listen to music whether I workout on my own or if I decide to take a class. I get to sweat...which can be a little gross, but I like that it shows me a little bit of proof that I worked hard and it also tells me that I'm hydrating properly (that's the nerd in me). And as for nutrition when its healthy it always tends to be good! There so many things to eat...there has to be something healthy that you like. Consistency in your fitness program which usually leads to consistent nutrition choice base (or vice versa). When I think of food it brings me comfort because it always makes me think of my family and friends. Although they may not all agree with the healthy life I live I still love to be around them. Also throughout the years some of my weird food ideas have rubbed off. </p>

                                            <p>As time rolls by I we start to think more and more about it. We try to hold on it it more. We try to cherish it more. Some of us want more of it, while some us can't wait for it to be over. It's been said that exercise gives us more time these days. The more you move the more you will be able to move in the future. On days like these I drag my feet and remind myself that it will only take up a little bit of my time. </p>
                                            <p> When will it be enough exercise...never. When will there be a day where I have done all that I can do? Never. That's when you have to find the fun. That way its not work...that way its not a pain point in your life. My favoirite thing to do is take a class. That ways I don't have to come p with what to do. I just show up and experience the fun. There are all kinds of classes out there. In my neighborhood I have a variety to choose from at LA Fitness, or many many Barre Studios, or even some pretty challenging Yoga Studios. I did a search through Groupon...they have amazing discounts. Annndd I picked one and here is what it was:
                                            </p>

                                            <p>It had a good amount of cardio to keep my heart rate up. Those gloves get heavy after holding them up for more than 10 minutes, and my abs are going to be sore for at least a week I swear. Get out there and do what you like with your time.</p>

                                            <p>Do you ever feel a rush when you start something new? It's one of the most exciting feelings. Standing at the front lines ready for this new adventure of proving to yourself that it is worth all the contemplation. On the other hand, there is also this immense fear. FOTU (Fear of the Unknown). What's going to happen? What steps have I decided to take? </p>
                                            <p> I like to randomly pick exercises to do some days. It makes me feel like I'm hitting the reset button. I end up feeling sore in places that I'm not used. It's all part of the journey...here is what I worked on:
                                                <ul id="workouts"> Here is my workout:
                                                    <li>Always start with a warm-up (5 miles on my spin bike today) </li>
                                                    <li>20  Dumbbell (DB) Bench Press</li>

                                                    <li>20 Ab Crunches</li>
                                                    <li>More cardio: Sprint on the spin bike 30 sec then slower 30 sec for 10 minutes</li>
                                                    <li>20 DB Bent Over Rows</li>

                                                    <li>Last bout of Cardio: Another 5 miles on the spin bike</li>
                                                    <li>20 Ab Crunches</li>
                                                    <li>20 Bosu Knee Tucks</li>
                                                    <li>30 sec Plank</li>
                                                    <li>Do each of these 2-5 rounds...Breathe through it!</li>

                                            <p>Its good to change your focus sometimes. My arms feel like jello, but that's the goal.   </p>

                                        <h2>What's the Point? : Muscle</h2>
                                        <img class="img-responsive img-blog" src="images/blog/Fit1.jpg" width="70%" alt="" />
                                            <p>Somedays I wonder why am I doing this. Pulling, pushing, and twisting rhythmically with or without weight all while jamming to some music. Other days I scroll through <a href="https://www.instagram.com/movethrutech/" target="_blank">Instagram</a> to find some inspiration as to what I want to do that day. What's my purpose? </p>
                                            <p> My purpose is to get stronger and maintain the activities that I am able to do. What does that mean? Basically when I reach the young age of 70 or 80 I want to be able to rock climb with my grandkids, help move boxes and furniture when I decide to downsize or move to paradise, and I want to avoid daily aches and pains for as long as possible. Because of my educational and professional background I am able to understand what it takes to maintain that level. I also know that I don't know it all...I constantly research because things are always changing. New ideas are always coming up and are out there. The curiosity that I have is unmatched especially since the internet is readily available and there is almost always and answer to questions that I may have.</p>
                                            <p>So today my goal is to strengthen the muscles that provide more stability in my knees. In conjunction I will be using my hips, ankles, and core(abdominals) to help me make the proper movements to accomplish that.
                                                <ul id="workouts"> Here is my workout:
                                                    <li>Always start with a warm-up (1 mile run) </li>
                                                    <li>15 push-ups</li>
                                                    <li>20 Walking Lunges with Dumbbell Bicep Curl</li>
                                                    <li>20 Squat Thrust</li>
                                                    <li>20 Squat Press</li>
                                                    <li>More cardio: Sprint 30 sec then Jog 30 sec for 10 minutes</li>
                                                    <li>20 Walking Lunges with Dumbbell Bicep Curl</li>

                                                    <li>20 Squat Press</li>
                                                    <li>Last bout of Cardio: Another 1 mile run</li>

                                                    <li>20 Bosu Knee Tucks</li>
                                                    <li>30 sec Plank</li>
                                                    <li>Do each of these 2-5 rounds...Fun! Fun!</li>
                                                </ul>
                                            </p>

                                            <p>Although this is not my typical workout it's always good to push your limits sometimes. I know these exercises are meant to be in my arsenal because they always make me exhausted when I'm done. Now time to hit the showers. </p>
